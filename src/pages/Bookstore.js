                As a new mom to a sweet little boy, I wanted to find some nice books he could read and learn from. Sounds easy right? So I thought. It appears that most bookstore apps are not very child-oriented, and finding the right books for age and content has become quite a challenge. So I have decided to put on my UX designer hat and go out into the wild to explore new ideas and solutions for such apps.

Next, I connected the benefits to the needs of my users (persona) and meets their pain points to identify what was really valuable to them.

                    Customizing apps and websites has been one of the hottest trends in user experience design for several years. It's nice to give users a product that will solve their problem, but it's better to offer them the option to adjust the interface to suit their specific needs.

                    Upon entering the app, users will answer a number of simple personal questions such as - the age of the child for whom the books are intended, favorite books, areas of interest and the like. The interface will then be updated and will recommend to the user customized books and will save the user a lot of time in searching for relevant books.
