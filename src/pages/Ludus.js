                UX design for an educational mobile application that helps elementary school students to improve their skills 
                and test themselves in mathematical subjects in an interactive game-like way. Ludos' goal is to help students excell in math 
                through smart analysis of their exams results, but to do so, students must first complete the exams.

                    We conducted interviews with students age 11, regarding their math exam experience. 
                    The goal was to understand the difficulties and the fun parts of studing and testing in math. 
                    We were guided by the following questions:

                    Many kids donâ€™t study because they find it boring. No one enjoys staring at the books studying until their brain hurts, 
                    and when studying is boring, kids often donâ€™t retain the information theyâ€™re trying to memorize. So in order to eliminate 
                    the old studying routine and to help our users make studying more fun, I conducted an online research to find, what do
